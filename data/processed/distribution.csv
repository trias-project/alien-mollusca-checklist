Unfortunately, there are no precise locality data of this observation and the material was not kept. The first well-documented record of the species in Belgium involves two adult specimens collected on 6 June 1973 in a garden at La Hestre, province of Hainaut (UTM ER89), close to the french border. Risch & Backeljau (1989) checked the identifications of “Arion rufus” in the collections of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (Brussels) by dissection of the genital apparatus and found that several samples actually involved Arion vulgaris. They provided a first distribution map showing that the species was mainly distributed in the southern part of Belgium up to Brussels, suggesting that the species invaded the country from the south, with probably human introductions around Brussels. Since then, it appears that the species has further expanded northward, so that it now occurs in suitable habitats all over the country (Van Goethem & Backeljau 2002). In fact it become far more common than the Arion rufus. Given that the species is often found in highly anthropogenic habitats, its spread is probably strongly mediated by human activities."

Currently the species seems to occur in suitable habitats all over the country, particularly in the dunes along the coast (Devriese et al. 2004), in the region around Antwerpen (e.g. Marquet 1985) and along the french border in central south Belgium (De Wilde et al. 1986).

Yet, it is not clear whether it was considered as being introduced. Colbeau (1868) referred to this record by a question mark, but without any further explanation. Yet, in 1866 Colbeau reported to have released Algerian specimens of Helix variabilis in his garden at Ahérée near Walcourt, as well as in dunes near Oostende (Anonymous 1867), but Staes was unable to find the species at Oostende in 1869 (Anonymous 1869).
Subsequently Adam (1935) and Adam & Leloup (1937) reported the species from De Panne, Raversijde and Mariakerke (the latter two localities close to Oostende). Since then the species has colonized the entire Belgian coastal dunes area (Devriese et al. 2004) and several other localities in the interior of the country. Common in the coastal dunes along the entire Belgian coast (Devriese et al. 2004). Also several localities elsewhere in the country, e.g. Brugge (1947a) and the harbour of Antwerpen (Marquet 1985; De Wilde et al. 1986). Shell-based records in Waarnemingen.be may need confirmation.

Yet, Kickx (1830) doubted about this record and Colbeau (1868) removed it from the list of the Belgian molluscs. However, in 1866 Colbeau (1867) introduced a number of specimens from Algeria in his garden in Etterbeek (Brussels). Specimens from Algeria were in the same year also introduced elsewhere in Belgium by F. Roffiaen (Genk) and J. Colbeau (in his garden at Ahérée near Walcourt and in dunes west of Oostende) (Anonymous 1867). Yet, except perhaps for the introduction near Oostende, none of these released populations bacame established. It is only in 1910 that Bouly de Lesdain (1911) reported the species again from dunes along the Belgian coast at De Panne. He claimed that the species arrived there by railway transport. Later on, the species was confirmed in De Panne by Dupuis (1924). The history of introduction of this species from northern France is briefly described by Adam (1947). Nowadays common in dunes and dry grassland vegetation along the entire Belgian coast. Yet, the colonization of this area apears to have taken place after the 1960ies, since up to 1956 the species seemed restricted to the area between De Panne and Nieuwpoort (Anteunis 1956). In 1981, the northernmost locality along the Belgian coast was Raversijde-Bad near Oostende (De Smet 1983) and in 1983 the species was reported further northward up to Wenduine (De Smet 1985). Since then the species has reached the dutch border (Waarnemingen.be) and it seems further expanding (Vercoutere et al. 2002; Devriese et al. 2004)."

This sampling locality is, however, imprecise as there are several localities with this (or a similar) name (Adam 1960). Nevertheless, Sevo (1974) claimed that this shell came from the “Fosse region”, which she situated near “Fosses-la-Ville” (postal code 5070) in the province of Namur (Sevo 1974: map 10). Yet, there exist also the village of “La Fosse” (also “Lafosse”, part of Manhay; postal code 6960) in the province of Luxembourg. So the origin of the shell reported by Dupuis (1924) remains unclear.
Much later, in July 1968 live specimens of G. frumentum were collected at three localities along the River Meuse, viz. Namur, Profondville (misspelling for Profondeville), and Rivière, while empty shells were collected at Dinant (Sevo 1974). However, Van Goethem (1984a,b, 1987, 1988) suggested that the specimens reported by Sevo (1974) are not G. frumentum, but instead refer to the common Abida secale. Conversely, Falkner et al. (2002) did suggest that Sevo's (1974) specimens belong to G. illyrica (here considered a subspecies of G. frumentum). Known only from the doubtful locality reported by Dupuis (1924) and the three localities reported by Sevo (1974). All in all it appears that the records in Belgium are at least questionable, even if Pilsbry (1918: 298) did mention “The typical P. frumentum of France, Belgium and southern germany is...”."

Earlier one shell of this species was reported from Austruweel in the Antwerpen harbour (Adam 1937), yet, as this shell was lost, its identity cannot be verified.
Previous records of this species from the Belgian coastal dunes by Adam (1947, 1960) refer to Cernuella aginnica (Clerx & Gittenberger 1977; Marquet 1985; Van Goethem 1988). It seems as if there are currently no surviving populations in Belgium."

Only known from the first record at the “Casino” of Antwerpen. The species was not found again at this site (Anonymous 1864). The record of this species from Waterloo near Brussels (Kickx 1830, De Malzine 1867) is probably erroneous (Anonymous [citing Colbeau] 1864; Colbeau 1865). The species is not mentioned in Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019)."

Yet, the species was mentioned in the checklists by Van Goethem (1984a, b, 1987, 1988) as occurring in Belgian greenhouses without any further specification. Still earlier, Moens (1979, 1980) explicitly mentioned the occurrence of the species in Belgian greenhouse, yet without providing any further details. Only reliably known from the record at the botanical garden of the University of Gent. No records in Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019). Probably more widespread in other botanical gardens and greenhouses (Moens 1979, 1980)."
