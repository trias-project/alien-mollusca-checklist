alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:81d4efabef9ab3e384dfe016ee69d01f	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	2003	Keppens & Dhondt 2007	The species was for the first time reported in Belgium in 2003 in the “Victoriakas” of the botanical garden of the University of Gent, where 16 empty shells and 8 living specimens were collected (Keppens & Dhondt 2007). Only known from the first record at the botanical garden of the University of Gent. No records in Waarnemingen.be (consulted on 4 February 2019). Probably more widespread in other botanical gardens and greenhouses.
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:7ecbd23986aa59aefd50154ef9f4fd1e	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1946	Van Goethem 1976 | De Wilde et al. 1986 | Kappes 2019 in press	The species was first recorded in Belgium in 1946 in a greenhouse at Brugge under the name Lehmannia marginata (Van Goethem 1976). No other records were reported until the species was rediscovered at Bredene (“Spuikom” near Oostende) in 1973 (Van Goethem 1976). Common throughout the country (Waarnemingen.be), but few well-documented published records (De Wilde et al. 1986).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:a4f4c57a54f834761b99b164aeb118b8	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1981	Moens 1981 | Risch & Backeljau 1989 | Van Goethem & Backeljau 2002	The species was first reported in Belgium by Moens (1981) who observed the species in a pasture in southern Belgium. Unfortunately, there are no precise locality data of this observation and the material was not kept. The first well-documented record of the species in Belgium involves two adult specimens collected on 6 June 1973 in a garden at La Hestre, province of Hainaut (UTM ER89), close to the french border. Risch & Backeljau (1989) checked the identifications of “Arion rufus” in the collections of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (Brussels) by dissection of the genital apparatus and found that several samples actually involved Arion vulgaris. They provided a first distribution map showing that the species was mainly distributed in the southern part of Belgium up to Brussels, suggesting that the species invaded the country from the south, with probably human introductions around Brussels. Since then, it appears that the species has further expanded northward, so that it now occurs in suitable habitats all over the country (Van Goethem & Backeljau 2002). In fact it become far more common than the Arion rufus. Given that the species is often found in highly anthropogenic habitats, its spread is probably strongly mediated by human activities.
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:d35bb708ec0c0b005948aff00d416a30	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1967	Van Goethem 1972 | Meijer 1968 | Schmid 1968 | Lambert 1971 | Lambert 1972 | De Zuttere et al. 1972 | De Wilde et al. 1983a | De Wilde et al. 1983b | De Wilde 1986a	According to Van Goethem (1972) the species was for the first time observed in Belgium in 1967 at Stavelot, where 2 specimens were collected by A.W. Janssen. Yet, no further data on this sample are available. Subsequently, the species was collected in Belgium by Meijer (1968) (Comblain-au-Pont, garden of hotel “Relais des Gourmets”, 12 May 1968), Schmid (1968) (Spa, near the waterfalls along road N32, 16 August 1968), Lambert (1971) (Valley of the Warche at Robertville, 11-12 July 1971), Lambert (1972) (Saint-Gérard, November 1971; Gosselies, March 1972; Loverval, May 1972; La Hestre, September-October 1972; Bertrix, September 1972; Chiny, 22 July 1972), and De Zuttere et al. (1972) (Castle of Reinhardstein at Robertville, 1972) , all involving records in the southern part of the country. Since its first observation in Belgium, the species has expanded its distribution up to the point that it currently occurs in suitable habitats throughout the whole country. This expansion has been documented in detail by De Wilde et al. (1983a, b, 1986a) and can be further followed at Waarnemingen.be since 2006.
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:2adf2a5200ff7ef289de75605a0ccdf1	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1922	Adam 1943 | Adam 1947 | Adam 1947b | Dupuis 1924b | Marquet 1985 | Devriese et al. 2004 | De Wilde et al. 1986b | Vercoutere et al. 2002 | Devriese et al. 2004	According to Adam (1943, 1947a, b) this species was not found in Belgium before 1922, but after that year it was commonly recorded in the dunes along the Belgian coast. Adam (1943, 1947b) also cited specimens collected by Dupuis (1924b) at Olloy-sur-Viroin and Vierves-sur-Viroin in southern Belgium, that were erroneously referred to as Helicella striata, but that in fact were undoubtedly C. intersecta. Currently the species seems to occur in suitable habitats all over the country, particularly in the dunes along the coast (Devriese et al. 2004), in the region around Antwerpen (e.g. Marquet 1985) and along the french border in central south Belgium (De Wilde et al. 1986b). There are many records in Waarnemingen.be and the species seems to expand further (Vercoutere et al. 2002; Devriese et al. 2004).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:2f422cf7ad1c9cb089045dabca55c28c	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1944	Vercoutere et al. 2002 | Devriese et al. 2004	There is no exact date of introduction, but the species seems to have colonized the Belgian coastal dunes area shortly after the Second World War, probably starting from Oostende (Vercoutere et al. 2002; Devriese et al. 2004). Common in the dune areas along the entire Belgian coast.
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:c5ebd7e74169e1df778d09719475277f	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1937	Adam 1947a | Adam 1947b | De Wilde et al. 1986 | Devriese et al. 2004	The first record of this species (under the name Helicella profuga) in Belgium dates from 1937 when a few empty shells were collected at Nieuwpoort-Bad. After the Second World War the species was abundantly recorded in Veurne (1945), between Nieuwpoort and Westende (1946), between Nieuwpoort and Oostduinkerke (1946), between De Panne and the french border (1946), and in Lombardsijde-Bad (1947) (Adam 1947a, b). Only known from the Belgian coastal dunes area, and there mainly restricted to the western part (De Wilde et al. 1986; Devriese et al. 2004). As such it seems as if the species is declining (Devriese et al. 2004). Recent records from elsewhere in Waarnemingen.be need confirmation.
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:0ab6daf4ae91b34b92171a41587f0fa7	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1972	Stiva 1973 | Manquet 1985 | De Wilde et al. 1986	This species was for the first time reported from Belgium by Stiva (1973) who collected it alive in 1972 at Lanaye. Poorly known because conchologically the species can be easily confused with other species that occur in Belgium, such as Cernuella virgata and C. aginnica. Therefore records reported at Waarnemingen.be may need verification. Nevertheless, the species was anatomically confirmed in the harbour area of Antwerpen (Marquet 1985; De Wilde et al. 1986b).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:02eac5f78d2af0f96a73471ee72461ec	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1867	De Malzine 1867 | Colbeau 1868 | Adam 1935 | Adam & Leloup 1937 | Marquet 1985 | De Wilde et al. 1986b | Devriese et al. 2004 | Vercoutere et al. 2002	The species was first reported in Belgium (under the name Helix variabilis) by De Malzine (1867) who found it abundantly south of Nieuwpoort. Yet, it is not clear whether it was considered as being introduced. Colbeau (1868) referred to this record by a question mark, but without any further explanation. Yet, in 1866 Colbeau reported to have released Algerian specimens of Helix variabilis in his garden at Ahérée near Walcourt, as well as in dunes near Oostende (Anonymous 1867), but Staes was unable to find the species at Oostende in 1869 (Anonymous 1869). Subsequently Adam (1935) and Adam & Leloup (1937) reported the species from De Panne, Raversijde and Mariakerke (the latter two localities close to Oostende). Since then the species has colonized the entire Belgian coastal dunes area (Devriese et al. 2004) and several other localities in the interior of the country. Common in the coastal dunes along the entire Belgian coast (Devriese et al. 2004). Also several localities elsewhere in the country, e.g. Brugge (1947a) and the harbour of Antwerpen (Marquet 1985; De Wilde et al. 1986b). Shell-based records in Waarnemingen.be may need confirmation. Yet, the species seems to expand (Vercoutere et al. 2002; Devriese et al. 2004).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:31bfed6d48cc5308c53149150572d92f	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	1828	Van den Ende 1828 | Kickx 1830 | Colbeau 1867 | Adam 1947a | Anteunis 1956 | De Smet 1983 | De Smet 1985 | Vecoutere et al. 2002 | Devriese et al. 2004 | Dupuis 1924b	The species was first reported by Van den Ende (1828). Yet, Kickx (1830) doubted about this record and Colbeau (1868) removed it from the list of the Belgian molluscs. However, in 1866 Colbeau (1867) introduced a number of specimens from Algeria in his garden in Etterbeek (Brussels). Specimens from Algeria were in the same year also introduced elsewhere in Belgium by F. Roffiaen (Genk) and J. Colbeau (in his garden at Ahérée near Walcourt and in dunes west of Oostende) (Anonymous 1867). Yet, except perhaps for the introduction near Oostende, none of these released populations bacame established. It is only in 1910 that Bouly de Lesdain (1911) reported the species again from dunes along the Belgian coast at De Panne. He claimed that the species arrived there by railway transport. Later on, the species was confirmed in De Panne by Dupuis (1924b). The history of introduction of this species from northern France is briefly described by Adam (1947a). Nowadays common in dunes and dry grassland vegetation along the entire Belgian coast. Yet, the colonization of this area apears to have taken place after the 1960ies, since up to 1956 the species seemed restricted to the area between De Panne and Nieuwpoort (Anteunis 1956). In 1981, the northernmost locality along the Belgian coast was Raversijde-Bad near Oostende (De Smet 1983) and in 1983 the species was reported further northward up to Wenduine (De Smet 1985). Since then the species has reached the dutch border (Waarnemingen.be) and it seems further expanding (Vercoutere et al. 2002; Devriese et al. 2004).

Afterwards it was never reported again until Dumoulin (1988) reported several living specimens from the “Dievegatkreek” at Knokke-Het Zoute, near the dutch border, collected on 15 September 1987. Found sporadically along the Belgian coastal area (Bauwens 2016; Waarnemingen.be). The population at the “Dievegatkreek” (Knokke-Het Zoute) seems stable in time and therefore may be reproducing.

Since then it seems to have spread rapidly throughout the country (Van Goethem et al. 1984; Van Goethem & Backeljau 2002). Nowadays common all over the country.

Colbeau intentionally released live specimens from Algeria in his garden at Ahérée, near Walcourt (Anonymous 1867). Yet, apparently these specimens did not survive. Much later the species was collected alive in Belgium on June 18th 2015 at Niel (51.10138 N, 4.33747 E) (Sablon et al. 2017). The specimens was found in a litter sample taken at an outdoor storage depot of pipes for construction works, adjacent to a wasteland and the nature reserve “Walenbos”. Only known from the first record at Niel. No records in Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019).

The plants were sent from The Netherlands, but came from a Belgian nursery at Westerlo (Mienis 2003). The occurrence of the species in Belgian nurseries and greenhouses needs further confirmation. No further records have been mentioned by Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:d12eaa6884b549d249857519fca4a376	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	doubtful	introduced	1924	Dupuis 1924a | Draparnaud 1801 | Adam 1960a | Sevo 1974 | Van Goethem 1984a | Van Goethem 1984b | Van Goethem 1987 | Van Goethem 1988 | Falkner et al. 2002	The species was first reported by Dupuis (1924a) who referred to a single shell in a sample of Abida secale (Draparnaud, 1801) from “Fosses”. This sampling locality is, however, imprecise as there are several localities with this (or a similar) name (Adam 1960a). Nevertheless, Sevo (1974) claimed that this shell came from the “Fosse region”, which she situated near “Fosses-la-Ville” (postal code 5070) in the province of Namur (Sevo 1974: map 10). Yet, there exist also the village of “La Fosse” (also “Lafosse”, part of Manhay; postal code 6960) in the province of Luxembourg. So the origin of the shell reported by Dupuis (1924a) remains unclear. Much later, in July 1968 live specimens of G. frumentum were collected at three localities along the River Meuse, viz. Namur, Profondville (misspelling for Profondeville), and Rivière, while empty shells were collected at Dinant (Sevo 1974). However, Van Goethem (1984a,b, 1987, 1988) suggested that the specimens reported by Sevo (1974) are not G. frumentum, but instead refer to the common Abida secale. Conversely, Falkner et al. (2002) did suggest that Sevo's (1974) specimens belong to G. illyrica (here considered a subspecies of G. frumentum). Known only from the doubtful locality reported by Dupuis (1924a) and the three localities reported by Sevo (1974). All in all it appears that the records in Belgium are at least questionable, even if Pilsbry (1918: 298) did mention “The typical P. frumentum of France, Belgium and southern germany is...”.

Subsequently it was not reported until it was found again in November 2006 at Labussière (Carrière des Carmes; province of Hainaut). Afterwards, between 2007 and 2011 the species was found at four more localities. Yet, since 2012 the species seems to expand rapidly in Belgium and in 2014 it was already known from 45 localities in 37 UTM 5 km squares, mainly in Brussels and Flanders. Between 2013 and 2017 another 23 new localities were reported in Wallonia. Currently (March 2018) the species has been reported from well over 70 localities, all over the country. Information based on a compilation of the data presented by Van den Neucker & Scheers (2014), Delcourt & Vilvens (2017) and Waarnemingen.be.

Subsequently, 12 specimens were collected on November 10th in the “Warandepark” in the centre of Brussels. Waarnemingen.be mentions that one dead shell was collected on March 30th 2012. Since the two records in 2014, the species has been repeatedly collected alive at several localities in Flanders and Wallonia (Waarnemingen.be).

Later the occurrence and spread of T. budapestensis in Belgium was confirmed by Moens (1959, 1962). Records in Belgium from before 1941 are highly doubtful. All over Belgium (De Wilde et al. 1986).

Moens (1983; Station Entomologique de l'état, Gembloux, Belgium). Unfortunately this material was not kept, so it cannot be checked. Nevertheless, Moens (1981) included the species in his identification key for Belgian terrestrial slugs. Previously, Schouten (1949) did mention that the species occurs in Belgium, yet he neither provided references, nor specimens to underpin his claim. There are a few records on Waarnemingen.be, but only a record of one slug from Altenbroek (2014; Voeren, Province of Limburg) seems to be documented and reliable. Two subsequent records from the same locality in 2016 are supposed to be reliable too. If these records are confirmed, then the 2014 specimen may be the first reliable record of the species in Belgium. Unknown

Deby, who claimed that the species lived in some gardens at Fonds-de-Leffe, near Dinant (Anonymous 1864a; Colbeau 1865). Still earlier, Colbeau (1859) stated that “Some persons believe that the species is acclimatized in some greenhouses and orangeries in our country”. Much later, Van Goethem (1987, 1988) reported a specimen that was collected in 1983 around Oostende and that was sent to him for verification in 1985 by K. Verschoore. A juvenile specimen was collected in 1977 in a winter garden at Temse. The specimen is deposited in the collections of the RBINS (I.G. 25.548) (Van Goethem 1988). No other records are known from Belgium. Nevertheless Rinaldi (2003) claims that the species is certainly present in Belgium.

Subsequently, the spread of the species was documented by several authors, e.g. Adam (1947a, b), Verhaeghe (1947), Anteunis (1956), and Deblock & Hoestlandt (1967). Currently the species is common in suitable habitats all over the Belgian coastal dune area (De Smet & Van Rompu 1989; Devriese et al. 2004; Severijns et al. 2013, 2015). There are also many records from this region in Waarnemingen.be, as well as some occasional records from elsewhere in the country (Zwijndrecht, Zelzate, Ledeberg, Opglabbeek). The record from the Antwerpen harbour mentioned by De Wilde et al. (1986) and cited by Devriese et al. (2004) is a misidentification and refers to the Xerosecta cespitum (Draparnaud, 1801) population reported by Marquet (1985).

Yet, the species was not found again at that locality (Marquet 1985). Much later, in 1980, a large living population of the species was recorded in the harbour of Antwerpen, where it survived at least until 1983 (Marquet 1985). Earlier one shell of this species was reported from Austruweel in the Antwerpen harbour (Adam 1937), yet, as this shell was lost, its identity cannot be verified. Previous records of this species from the Belgian coastal dunes by Adam (1947a, 1960a) refer to Cernuella aginnica (Clerx & Gittenberger 1977; Marquet 1985; Van Goethem 1988). It seems as if there are currently no surviving populations in Belgium.

Only known from the first record at the “Casino” of Antwerpen. The species was not found again at this site (Anonymous 1864b). The record of this species from Waterloo near Brussels (Kickx 1830, De Malzine 1867) is probably erroneous (Anonymous [citing Colbeau] 1864; Colbeau 1865). The species is not mentioned in Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019).
alien-mollusca-checklist:taxon:6d29214a267467f07437d66a1cdfbcc3	ISO_3166-2:BE	Belgium	BE	present	introduced	2003	Moens 1979 | Moens 1980 | Keppens & Dhondt 2007	The species was for the first time well documented in Belgium in 2003 in the “Victoriakas” of the botanical garden of the University of Gent (Keppens & Dhondt 2007). Yet, the species was mentioned in the checklists by Van Goethem (1984a, b, 1987, 1988) as occurring in Belgian greenhouses without any further specification. Still earlier, Moens (1979, 1980) explicitly mentioned the occurrence of the species in Belgian greenhouse, yet without providing any further details. Only reliably known from the record at the botanical garden of the University of Gent. No records in Waarnemingen.be (accessed on 4 February 2019). Probably more widespread in other botanical gardens and greenhouses (Moens 1979, 1980).
