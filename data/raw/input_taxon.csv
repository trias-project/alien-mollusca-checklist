"Allopeas clavulinum (Potiez & Michaud, 1835)","Well-defined species. For the correct authorship of the name Allopeas clavulinum (Potiez & Michaud, 1835) see Bank & Menkhorst (2008).
The species is also known as Lamellaxis clavulinus.","Gastropoda Cuvier, 1795","Stylommatophora A. Schmidt, 1855","Subulinidae P. Fischer & Crosse, 1877","Allopeas H. B. Baker, 1935"

"Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon, 1855","The scientific name of this species is not yet firmly established. Formerly the species was often referred to as Arion lusitanicus Mabille, 1868, until it appeared that Mabille's taxon from Portugal is another species. Yet, many authors continued to use the name Arion lusitanicus for the invasive species using the authorship “auctorum, non Mabille, 1868”. Alternatively, the name Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon 1855 has been proposed for the invasive species. The case is currently presented to the ICZN (Balashov 2018).","Gastropoda Cuvier, 1795","Stylommatophora A. Schmidt, 1855","Arionidae Gray, 1840","Arion A. Férussac, 1819"

"Cernuella cisalpina (Rossmässler, 1837)","The species status of this taxon is still not entirely clear. Hausdorf & Sauer (2009) for example suggest that it is conspecific with Cernuella virgata, while Manganelli et al. (2005) treated C. cisalpina and C. virgata as different species, while Manganelli et al. (1995) discuss the problems and maintain the two species. Welter-Schultes (2012) supports the latter opinion, but suggests that “C. cisalpina” populations outside Italy might still be another species or could represent a small form of C. virgata. Hybridization between C. cisalpina and C. virgata has been suggested (Kerney & Cameron 1980 as C. jonica; Van Goethem 1988 Note 83 as C. jonica).
For the time being we keep C. cisalpina as a separate species.","Gastropoda Cuvier, 1795","Stylommatophora A. Schmidt, 1855","Geomitridae C.R. Boettger, 1910","Cernuella Schlüter, 1839"

"Deroceras invadens Reise, Hutchinson, Schunack & Schlitt, 2011",Well-defined species. The species has long time been confused with Deroceras panormitanum and Deroceras caruanae.

"Ferussacia folliculum (Schröter, 1784)","Well-defined species. The spelling of the species name is still unsettled and confusing. It is not the place here to discuss this nomenclatural issue in detail. Yet, assuming that Schröter's (1784) book complies with the requirements imposed by the ICZN (e.g. application of binomial nomenclature), we follow Welter-Schultes (2012) and Bank (2016) by using “Ferussacia folliculum (Schröter, 1784)”, even if the more recent checklists of Bank & Neubert (2017) and the Fauna Europaea on-line database (https://fauna-eu.org/cdm_dataportal/taxon/8cccd942-28c8-4677-8403-95e990353f0c; accessed on 7 August 2018) cite this species as “Ferussacia folliculus (Schröter, 1784)” and “Ferussacia folliculus (Gmelin, 1791)” respectively. Yet, the on-line version of Bank & Neubert (2017) at MolluscaBase cite “Ferussacia folliculum (Schröter, 1784)” as accepted name, but with the same spelling as “accepted, alternate representation” (http://www.molluscabase.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=580515; accessed on 8 August 2018).","Gastropoda Cuvier, 1795","Stylommatophora A.
