"Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon, 1855","unclear. Formerly believed to be native in SW Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Yet, the Arion lusitanicus Mabille, 1868 from Portugal is a different, locally endemic species. Moreover, there still is discussion as to whether or not the species is truly invading central Europe, for Pfenninger et al. (2014) have suggested that the species is native in central Europe and hence that it is not an alien invader there. Yet, Zemanova et al. (2016) questioned this suggestion and maintained that the species is invading central Europe.
For Belgium there is little doubt that Arion vulgaris is an alien invader, since the extensive collections of Arion rufus in the RBINS that were made during surveys in the 20th century (going back to 1917) show that Arion vulgaris only starts to pop up among samples collected after 1970, and becomes more and more common towards the end of the 20th century.","Probably introduced both by natural dispersal and spreading by human activities, including transport of plants, construction materials, tourism (e.g. camping equipment), etc.",Fully invasive species.

"Candidula intersecta (Poiret, 1801)",Probably southwestern France and the western part of the Iberian Peninsula.,The species may have been unintentionally introduced in the coastal areas by military transports and activities during the World Wars (Adam 1947a; Vercoutere 2002). In the second half of the 20th century the species might also have been unintentionally introduced by attachment on tourist camping material.

"Cochlicella acuta (O.F. Müller, 1774)",circum-Mediterranean.,It appears that the species may have reached Belgium by deliberate human-mediated introductions and accidental railway transport.

"Testacella haliotidea Draparnaud, 1801","S Europe and W Mediterranean. According to Van Goethem (1987, 1988) and Rinaldi (2003) the species is probably authochtonous in Belgium. Yet, despite dedicated searches by J. Colbeau in the 19th century, W. Adam about halfway the 20th century (Adam 1947) and still more recent surveys (e.g. Marquet 1982) there is no convincing evidence of this.",Unintentionally introduced with foreign plant materials (Van Goethem 1988).,A few accidental introductions; category C0.,"southern Europe, western Mediterranean",stowaway,C0,
"Theba pisana (O.F. Müller, 1774)","Probably nortwestern Africa (Morocco, Algeria) and circum western Mediterranean coastal areas.","The species probably colonized our coastal dunes by natural dispersal from populations in northern France (Adam 1947a, b). Yet, these populations in northern France themselves may at least in part have been established by intentional human introductions. For example, in 1895 A. Giard deliberately introduced the species at Pointe aux Oies (Boulogne-sur-Mer, département Pas-de-Calais) using animals from the island of Tatihou (off Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, département la Manche (Dutertre 1927; Cucherat 2006). As such it is not excluded that some populations in the Belgian coastal dunes (and elsewhere) are due to human introductions. For example, in 1866 J. Colbeau and E. Lanszweert intentionally released Algerian specimens of Theba pisana in dunes at Oostende to see whether they would acclimatize (Anonymous 1867; Anonymous 1869). Hence it is possible that the population discovered by Hostie (1935) at Mariakerke derived from these introduced specimens (Adam 1947b). In the same spirit J. Colbeau released Algerian Theba pisana in his garden at Ahérée, near Walcourt (Anonymous 1867). Yet, it seems that this latter population did not survive.",Fully invasive species; category E.,"nortwestern Africa, circum western Mediterranean coastal areas","disperal, relaese",E,"Van Goethem 1987, Van Goethem 1988, Rinaldi 2003, Adam 1947, Marquet 1982"
